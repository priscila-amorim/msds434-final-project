# Weather Application: Final Project for MSDS 434

This GitHub repo contains the files necessary to deploy a weather prediction application to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The file called "main.py" runs an API called Open Weather Map API that grabs the latest data for the given cities, including San Diego, Toronto, Miami, and more. The "requirements.txt" file includes packages necessary to run this application, including gunicorn and Flask. 

I also created HTML and CSS files for page aesthetics of the applications. The app is run on GCP by running the command "gcloud app deploy". Finally, the link to the website is here: https://weatherapiflask.appspot.com/.
